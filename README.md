<h3 style="font-family: calibri"> Documenting my weekly journey learning coding for the first time.  Here's my first website!  How do you like it?</h3>It might seem strange to you but I've never coded html before.  I guess it's never too late to start!</h2>

<h2>Week 4: HTML </h2>
<p> So I started this coding school called Skillcrush.  I've been working on it every week.  Sometimes it's pretty smooth, other times it's a little tough.  I think that the stuff I'm having trouble with is CSS.  </p>

<h2>Week 8: HTML </h2>
<p> I really hope that I can learn a lot here... So far, I feel like I have learned some stuff, but the question is, will I be able to really apply it?  I mean, the tags that I have used in this page thus far have been very basic and simple.  What happens when we get to CSS?  There was one confusing section in there.  I think I might have to talk to an instructor during office hours.</p>
<p1> It's taking a little while to finish up the HTML part... I just have so much stuff going on outside of class.  I do get to knock out a few lessons at a time once in a while</p1>

<div class="entries">
<h2>Week 10:  CSS</h2>
<p> I'm halfway thru CSS now... I'm telling you, the HTML and CSS parts are pretty tough at certain points.  I still have to understand if <span> is really that important... I'm just REALLY glad that designers don't really use code on a normal basis on the job!!  HAHAHA. </p>
<p1> Muse on pandora is actually keeping me sane right now ahaha.  I totally understood how to add an IMG tag and the link, but then when I tried to apply it here, it wouldn't work! ?  Argh!
I'm actually pissed off about it right now.
